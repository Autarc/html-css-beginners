Welcome to Open Tech School’s HTML & CSS workshop! This course is a
simple and comprehensive guide dedicated to helping beginners learn HTML
and CSS.

**HTML or HyperText Markup Language** is the main markup language for
creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web
browser. You can write your web application in any programming
languages, but in the end it will always be transformed into HTML
because that’s the language of the browser. It is a hierarchical
language.

**A short bit of history** HTML was developed at the CERN in
Switzerland. Its inventor is Tim Berners-Lee. In 1980 he wrote his first
hypertext system for personal use - the predecessor of HTML. With the
first browser and server software the very young internet and HTML made
their way to conquer the world. In 1992 two copies of a free web browser
were downloaded from a computer at CERN to a computer in the USA. In
1995 the first Internet Explorer was published.

| And **HTML5**? What’s that?
| This is just the latest version of HTML. There is a lot of interest
about it, because it improves and adds many HTML elements, making it
easier to write and to use.

| **What about CSS?**
| CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a language used for describing the
look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. It is
closely connected with HTML, since it gives style to HTML elements. In
contrast to HTML, CSS has no hierarchy and can be written in the order
that we choose.

**CSS3** is the last released version of CSS, and it also improves CSS a
lot. For example, it gives the possibility to animate an element.

What we’ll do today
-------------------

Today we will learn how to write a web page with HTML and style it with
CSS. Our goal is to create a personal portfolio page with a presentation
and contact page.

Once you are done with your personal portfolio, you can explore some
interesting links that you can find below the “Extra” section. If you’re
extra curious once you are done with the portfolio, these resources will
help you to keep coding with HTML and CSS or just keep you updated about
what’s next.
